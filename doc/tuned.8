.SH NAME
tuned \- dynamic adaptive system tuning daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtuned\fP [\fIoptions\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtuned\fR is a dynamic adaptive system tuning daemon
that tunes system settings dynamically depending on
usage. It does so by monitoring the usage of several system components
periodically. Based on that information components will be put into
lower or higher power saving modes to adapt to the current usage. Currently
only ethernet network and ATA harddisk devices are implemented.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 12
.BI \-d "\fR, \fP" \--daemon
This options starts tuned as a daemon as opposed to
in the foreground without forking at startup.
.TP 12
.BI \-c "\fR, \fP" \--conffile=" conffile"
Specify the name and path of the configuration file, default is \fB/etc/tuned.conf\fR.
.SH BUGS
Using NetworkManager and tuned in the same time will completely stop and start NetworkManager.
The inconvenience is done by tuned, which is setting the power saving levels.
This happens because the network device will loose it's physical
link for a very short time when it performs a power saving switch and
NetworkManager can not distinguish this from a connectivity loss. This will be
resolved in future versions of tuned and NM where NM will gain the mechanism to
switch speeds for network devices.
