As a system administrator, you can use the *Tuned* service to optimize the performance profile of your system for a variety of use cases.

////
This is a suggested Table of Contents, taken from BZ#1340944:

* Tuned introduction & overview
* Tuned (service) + available parameters
* The config files description: /etc/tuned/*
* tuned-adm (use content currently in the PTG and update/expand)
* Plug-ins and their parameters -- move from the guide part of the PTG, rewrite, update.
* Profiles -- move from the guide part of the PTG, rewrite, update
   ** how to create profiles and inheritance (the guide part will link here for details)
   ** description of profiles that are provided with tuned in RHEL 7
   ** customizing profiles
* Creating plug-ins 
   ** will be probably short, not a priority
   ** jkarvad will provide a first draft
* Manual pages -- updated and expanded
