<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Tuned is a daemon that uses udev to monitor connected devices and tunes system settings
according to a selected profile. It has plugin architecture to support various types of
configuration like sysctl, sysfs, kernel boot command line parameters, etc. All configuration
is stored in one place - in the so called Tuned profile. So instead of having configuration on multiple
places and in custom scripts it can be cleanly handled by Tuned profiles. Tuned profiles can be
defined hiearchicaly which can reduce duplication and simplify maintenance, i.e. more specialized
profiles can inherit generic profiles and just change what's needed instead of duplicating the code.
For example you can built generic profile for HTTP server upon throughput-performance profile and later
create two more specialized profiles for Apache server and Nginx server both profiles based on the generic
HTTP server profile.</p>

<p>When applying the profile full rollback is supported, i.e. the system can be easily returned to the
state before the profile was applied. This can be handy for testing, benchmarking, experimenting, etc.
For example you can setup cron to have different profile applied during business hours and different
during night. Tuned supports hot plugging of devices and it can be controlled from the command line or
through the D-Bus, so it can be easily integrated into existing administering solutions. For example
at the moment it can be used with Cockpit.</p>

<p>Tuned is distributed with a number of predefined profiles for common use cases like high
throughput, low latency, or powersave. Profiles optimizing performance for various products
like SAP, dBase servers, etc. are also provided and it's possible to customize them. For systems with
reduced resources Tuned can be run in no-daemon mode with limited functionality (e.g. no support
for D-Bus, udev, tuning of newly created processes, etc.).</p>

<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p>Some documentation is available in the
<a href="https://docs-old.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/20/html/Power_Management_Guide/tuned.html">Fedora Power Management Guide</a>,
but it's incomplete and may not be up-to-date. New documentation is worked on.</p>
