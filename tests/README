Tests can be started with "make test" command from parent directory
or by executing "tuned-test.py" script.

The tests can not be run in completely isolated environment. You need
tuned and tuned-utils packages installed and you have to run the test
as superuser (needed for tuned-adm tests). Please note that your
settings of tuned can be changed.

What is tested

 * monitor-plugins have to implement: init(), getLoad(), cleanup()
 * tuning-plugins have to implement: init(), setTuning(), cleanup()
 * each monitor-plugin has to have it's tuning-plugin with the same
   name
 * the result of monitor's getLoad() function is passed to setTuning(),
   therefore tuning's getLoad() must not return Null
 * "tuned-adm list" correctness
 * "tuned-adm off" has to:
    - stop tuned a ktune services
    - remove (disable) tuned a ktune services
    - remove "/etc/ktune.d/tunedadm.{sh,conf}"
 * there are fake-profiles available for "tuned-adm profile <name>":
    - disabled-all
    - enabled-all
    - enabled-ktune
    - enabled-tuned
   tuned-adm has to:
    - stop/start service(s)
    - add/remove/disable service(s)
    - set up "/etc/ktune.d/tunedadm.{sh,conf}"

What is NOT tested

 * monitor-plugins getLoad() data validity
 * tuning-plugins setTuning() system setting changes
