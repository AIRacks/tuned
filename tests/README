Tests can be started with "make test" command from parent directory
or by executing "tuned-test.py" script.

The tests can not be run in completely isolated environment. You need
tuned and tuned-utils packages installed and you have to run the test
as superuser (needed for tuned-adm tests). Please note that your
settings of tuned can be changed.

Tests for tuned-adm control tuned currently installed on your system.
If you made some changes in the tuned code and are going to verify
it using this test, please, build the tuned RPM package from your
sources, install it and then run this test.

What is tested

 * monitor-plugins have to implement: init(), getLoad(), cleanup()
 * tuning-plugins have to implement: init(), setTuning(), cleanup()
 * each monitor-plugin has to have it's tuning-plugin with the same
   name
 * the result of monitor's getLoad() function is passed to setTuning(),
   therefore tuning's getLoad() must not return Null
 * "tuned-adm list" correctness
 * "tuned-adm off" has to:
    - stop tuned a ktune services
    - remove (disable) tuned a ktune services
    - remove "/etc/ktune.d/tunedadm.{sh,conf}"
 * there are fake-profiles available for "tuned-adm profile <name>":
    - disabled-all
    - enabled-all
    - enabled-ktune
    - enabled-tuned
    - disabled-config (tuned enabled, but all plugins disabled in tuned.conf)
   tuned-adm has to:
    - stop/start service(s)
    - add/remove/disable service(s)
    - set up "/etc/ktune.d/tunedadm.{sh,conf}"

What is NOT tested

 * monitor-plugins getLoad() data validity
 * tuning-plugins setTuning() system setting changes
